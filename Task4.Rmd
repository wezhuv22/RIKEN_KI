## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

## Q1. Square root of 10
# Square root of 10
sqrt(10)

##Q2
# Logarithm base 2
log(32, base = 2)
#Q3
# Sum of numbers from 1 to 1000
sum(1:1000)
#Q4
# Sum of even numbers from 2 to 1000
sum(seq(2, 1000, by = 2))

# Alternative method: 2*(1+2+...+500)
sum(2*(1:500))

#Q5
# Pairwise comparisons among 100 genes
n <- 100
choose(n, 2)

#Q6
# Number of ordered triples from 100 genes
n <- 100
k <- 3
prod(n:(n-k+1))   # 100*99*98

# Equivalent method using factorials
factorial(n)/factorial(n-k)

sessionInfo()


```

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
